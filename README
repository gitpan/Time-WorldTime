Hello:

Thank you for deciding to use Time::WorldTime. Documentation for this 
module should be installed at the same time as this module.  If you are 
impatient, this documentation is extracted from the bottom of the 
"WorldTime.pm" file, which is in POD format, so you may look there.

Installation is standard:

perl Makefile.pl
make
make test
make install

Time::WorldTime is Copyright 2000 (c) Philip Mikal. All rights reserved. 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the same terms as Perl itself.

Enjoy!
